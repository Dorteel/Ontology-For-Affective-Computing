# The Nature of Emotions
[Source](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27857503)

The behaviourist view is that the only objective way to study emotion is through the behaviour of the entity holding the emotion.

# My take
I believe emotions are energies on the complex landscape of the soul.
They act on the good - bad (pleasant - unpleasant) dimensions for sure, but other dimensions also play a role.
They are signals - energies we receive
They are linked to goals or hierarchies of values.
